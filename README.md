## Eaternity Database Docu
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/prose/prose.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/prose/prose)

The Eaternity Database is a collection of files and tools.
1. Ingredient data is stored in the JSON data format in a [non-public GitHub repository](http://prose.io/#eaternity-agent/Eaternity-Datenbank). There is one .json file per ingredient.
2. [Jekyll-DB](https://github.com/rypan/jekyll-db) is used to display an overview of all ingredients to the user. The user can search for keywords and select the file to edit.
3. Data is edited in [Prose](http://prose.io/). Thus, the full advantage of GitHub's versioning system is offered to the users.





__Attention: This is an enhanced version of Prose in combination with JSON Form.__

Prose provides a beautifully simple content authoring environment for [CMS-free websites](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/). It's a web-based interface for managing content on [GitHub](http://github.com). Use it to create, edit, and delete files, and save your changes directly to GitHub. Host your website on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) for free, or set up your own [GitHub webhook server](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2013/05/01/introducing-jekyll-hook/).
